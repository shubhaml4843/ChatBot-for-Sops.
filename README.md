## Project Summary: ChatBot for SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

This project is a **web application** that allows users to interact with a chatbot designed to process and extract information from **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** documents in **PDF ,DOCS ETC**. The application uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models to enable features such as **question answering** and **summarization** of SOP documents.

### Features:
- **Document Upload**: Users can upload a PDF file containing an SOP document for processing.
- **Document Indexing**: The uploaded SOP document is processed and indexed into a **FAISS vector store** for fast retrieval.
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions about the SOP, and the application provides relevant answers by querying the indexed content.
- **Summarization**: Users can request a summary of the SOP document or the answer to their question.
  
### Technology Stack:
- **Langchain**: To load and index documents, and for managing embeddings.
- **FAISS**: For fast retrieval of document content based on embeddings.
- **Cohere or Hugging Face**: For generating text embeddings, with an option to choose between Cohere's embeddings or Hugging Face's transformers models.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face pipelines are used for question answering and summarization.

### Usage:
1. **Upload a PDF**: The user uploads an SOP PDF document.
2. **Ask Questions**: The user can type a question, and the chatbot will provide an answer based on the content of the SOP.
3. **Summarize**: The user can also request a summary of the entire SOP document or a summary of the generated answer.

### How It Works:
- The SOP document is loaded and converted into text using **PyMuPDFLoader**.
- **CohereEmbeddings** or **HuggingFaceEmbeddings** are used to convert the document into a vector representation, which is stored in a **FAISS vector store** for fast retrieval.
- When a question is asked, the chatbot looks for the most relevant parts of the document and generates an answer. If the user asks for a summary, the answer or the entire document can be summarized using NLP models.

### Options:
- **Cohere API**: Use Cohere's API for generating embeddings and text responses.
- **Hugging Face API**: Alternatively, Hugging Face models can be used for both question answering and summarization.

### Example Use Case:
1. **Upload your SOP PDF document.**
2. **Ask questions**: "What is the procedure for handling customer complaints?"
3. **View answers and summaries**: Get detailed answers and concise summaries of the answer or the entire SOP document.

### Setup:
- Install necessary dependencies: `pip install langchain transformers faiss-cohere cohere`
- Configure your **Cohere API key** if using Cohere embeddings.

### Key Benefits:
- **Efficient SOP Querying**: Quickly find answers to specific queries about a large SOP document.
- **Automatic Summarization**: Get concise summaries of long documents for quick understanding.
- **Flexible Integration**: Choose between different embeddings and LLM options (Cohere or Hugging Face) based on the user's preference.

This project provides a powerful tool for interacting with and extracting information from SOP documents, ideal for businesses and organizations looking to improve accessibility and usability of their procedural documentation.
