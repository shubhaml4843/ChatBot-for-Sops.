## Project Summary: ChatBot for SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

This project is a **web application** that allows users to interact with a chatbot designed to process and extract information from **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** documents in **PDF format**. The application leverages **Language Models (LM)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **AI**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques, along with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, to enable features such as **question answering**, **text summarization**, and **document summarization** of SOP documents.

### Features:
- **Document Upload**: Users can upload a PDF file containing an SOP document for processing.
- **Document Indexing**: The uploaded SOP document is processed and indexed into a **FAISS vector store** for fast retrieval using vector-based search.
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions about the SOP, and the application provides relevant answers by querying the indexed content.
- **Text Summarization**: The application provides summarization of text-based responses to user queries, helping to generate concise answers.
- **Document Summarization**: Users can request a summary of the entire SOP document to quickly grasp its content.
  
### Technology Stack:
- **Langchain**: To load and index documents, and for managing embeddings and text generation logic.
- **FAISS**: A vector database for fast retrieval of document content based on embeddings.
- **Cohere or Hugging Face**: For generating text embeddings, with an option to choose between Cohere's embeddings or Hugging Face's transformers models.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face pipelines are used for question answering and summarization.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines traditional search with generative language models to provide more accurate and context-aware answers by retrieving relevant information before generating a response.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding, interpreting, and processing the textual content of the SOP documents and user queries. Summarization is applied using NLP models to condense the document or answers into more digestible formats.

### Usage:
1. **Upload a PDF**: The user uploads an SOP PDF document.
2. **Ask Questions**: The user can type a question, and the chatbot will provide an answer based on the content of the SOP.
3. **Summarize the Text**: The user can ask for a summarized response of the detailed answer.
4. **Summarize the Entire Document**: The user can also request a summary of the entire SOP document.

### How It Works:
- The SOP document is loaded and converted into text using **PyMuPDFLoader**.
- **CohereEmbeddings** or **HuggingFaceEmbeddings** are used to convert the document into a vector representation, which is stored in a **FAISS vector store** for fast retrieval.
- When a question is asked, the chatbot looks for the most relevant parts of the document using **vector search** and generates an answer. If the user asks for a summary, the answer or the entire document can be summarized using **NLP-based summarization models**.
- The integration of **RAG** ensures that the most relevant information is retrieved before generating accurate, contextually aware responses.

### Options:
- **Cohere API**: Use Cohere's API for generating embeddings and text responses.
- **Hugging Face API**: Alternatively, Hugging Face models can be used for both question answering and summarization.

### Example Use Case:
1. **Upload your SOP PDF document.**
2. **Ask questions**: "What is the procedure for handling customer complaints?"
3. **View answers and summaries**: Get detailed answers and concise summaries of the answer or the entire SOP document.

### Setup:
- Install necessary dependencies: `pip install langchain transformers faiss-cohere cohere`
- Configure your **Cohere API key** if using Cohere embeddings.

### Key Benefits:
- **Efficient SOP Querying**: Quickly find answers to specific queries about a large SOP document by using vector-based search and NLP.
- **Automatic Summarization**: Get concise summaries of long documents for quick understanding.
- **Text Summarization for Answers**: Summarize answers to user queries into shorter, more digestible text.
- **RAG-based Retrieval**: Combines retrieval with generative models to provide highly accurate and context-aware answers.
- **Flexible Integration**: Choose between different embeddings and LLM options (Cohere or Hugging Face) based on the user's preference.

This project provides a powerful tool for interacting with and extracting information from SOP documents, ideal for businesses and organizations looking to improve accessibility and usability of their procedural documentation using the latest advances in **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Text Summarization**.
